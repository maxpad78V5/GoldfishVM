    <p>
     The place of origin where goldfish came from is from China. Goldfish are a member of the carp family.
     The chinese use these goldfish as domestic pets and only the royal families can have yellow color goldfish.
     A yellow color goldfish represents the royal families. People not related to the royale families can't keep yellow 
     goldfishs as it is illegal to keep one. Now a days there is no punishment for keeping a certain color of golfish in
     your hands. People can keep other color goldfish
